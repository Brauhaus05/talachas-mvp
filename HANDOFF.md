# Session Handoff — 2026-07-03

> Read alongside [prd.md](./prd.md) and [plan.md](./plan.md). This captures what the code and git log **don't** — session decisions, verification state, and where to pick up.

## Where we are

| Phase | Status |
|---|---|
| **0 — Foundation** | ✅ merged (`f9b0321`) — Next 16, React 19, Tailwind v4, next-intl, CI |
| **1 — Clickable demo (5 Figma screens, mock data)** | ✅ merged (`843107f`) |
| **2 — Data model + Auth** | ✅ merged (PR #1) |
| **3 — Search / profile / booking (real data)** | ✅ merged (PR #2 + #3) — exit criterion met |
| **4A — Stripe Connect onboarding** | ✅ merged (PR #4) — **onboarding flow needs live Stripe test verification (in progress by owner)** |
| **4B — Payment intents / capture / refund / tips / ledger** | ⏳ next, after 4A onboarding is confirmed working |

`main` is at merge commit `9e5e772`. Working tree clean. The local Supabase stack + seed reproduce everything.

## Phase 3 — what shipped (real data behind the Figma screens)

- **`neighborhoods`** table (CDMX colonias, `geography(Point)` centers) + `neighborhood_id` / `jobs_completed` on `talachero_profiles`. Coverage = center point + radius (MVP decision).
- **`SECURITY DEFINER` directory + booking functions** — talachero names, review authors, and the other party in a booking all live behind `users` RLS (own-row only), so curated `SECURITY DEFINER` functions (not views) expose safe projections:
  - `list_talacheros(p_id)`, `get_talachero_reviews(p_id)`
  - `create_booking` (**`SELECT … FOR UPDATE` on the slot → no double-booking**), `respond_to_booking` (accept/reject), `cancel_booking`, `get_my_bookings`, `get_talachero_bookings`
- **`supabase/seed.sql`** — ~10 demo talacheros created as **real auth users** (via the signup trigger), fleshed out with profiles, services, 14 days of availability, and completed bookings + reviews. Written as a **single `DO` block** (temp tables don't survive the seed runner's batching). All demo accounts: password `password123`.
- **UI** — data layer maps RPC rows into the Phase 1 `Talachero` view shape (components unchanged). Real slot picker on the booking form; confirm is a server action calling `create_booking`; client + talachero dashboards list real bookings with cancel / accept / reject.

**Verified end-to-end** (SQL race test + browser): client books a real slot → both dashboards → talachero accepts → confirmed; two clients racing one slot → one wins, one gets `slot_unavailable` cleanly.

## Phase 4A — what shipped (Stripe Connect onboarding)

- Schema: `stripe_account_id` / `charges_enabled` / `payouts_enabled` on profiles; `stripe_payment_intent_id` / `tip_payment_intent_id` / `payment_status` on bookings; `stripe_events` (webhook idempotency). **Money columns are server-only** (`REVOKE UPDATE … FROM authenticated`).
- Lazy server-only Stripe client (apiVersion pinned to the SDK's `2026-06-24.dahlia`) + a service-role Supabase client for trusted Stripe-driven writes.
- Connect Express onboarding (server actions → account + account link → redirect), talachero dashboard **PaymentsPanel**, and a signature-verified idempotent `/api/stripe/webhook` handling `account.updated`.
- **Verified without keys**: typecheck/lint/build clean, panel renders the not-onboarded state. **Live onboarding + webhook still need the owner's Stripe test account** — runbook below.

## ▶ Verify 4A now (owner, with Stripe test keys)

1. Enable **Connect** in Stripe (test mode). Put `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_…` in `.env.local`.
2. `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook` → copy the `whsec_…` into `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
3. `pnpm dev`, sign in as `carlos.mendoza@demo.talachas.mx` / `password123` → dashboard → **Configurar pagos** → finish Stripe test onboarding.
4. Back on the dashboard, click **Actualizar estado** (or let `account.updated` fire). Panel should flip to **Activos**; `charges_enabled` / `payouts_enabled` become true.

## Phase 4B (next, once 4A is confirmed)

Money model (agreed): **15% fee via env, manual capture.**
- PaymentIntent at booking confirm — manual capture, `application_fee_amount` = 15%, `transfer_data.destination` = talachero's Connect account. Client authorizes via Stripe Checkout/Elements.
- Capture on booking `completed` (needs a talachero "mark completed" action). Refund on cancel. Tips = separate PaymentIntent.
- `transactions` ledger rows written from payment webhooks (`checkout.session.completed`, `payment_intent.*`, `charge.refunded`) — idempotent via `stripe_events`. Every financial op uses idempotency keys.
- Gate paid bookings on the talachero's `charges_enabled`.

## Stack + decisions confirmed

- Frontend/hosting: Next.js on Vercel · DB/auth/storage/realtime: Supabase · Payments: Stripe Connect
- **KYC**: Connect Express hosted onboarding drives `verification_status` (no separate Stripe Identity for MVP)
- **Coverage area**: center point + radius (not polygon) for MVP
- **Location UX**: neighborhood picker (colonia points + `ST_DWithin`) — **deferred**, lands when a location input appears in search
- **Commission**: 15% via `PLATFORM_FEE_PCT` env
- **Slot granularity**: 1 hour; a booking reserves one slot (`hours` is an informational price estimate)
- **Chat provider (Phase 5)**: default Supabase Realtime

## Still-open / deferred

- Talachero **onboarding form + availability editor** (profiles/slots are seed-only today; RLS + column grants already allow the owner to edit presentational fields)
- **Neighborhood picker + `ST_DWithin`** search (directory functions are the seam)
- Cancellation-policy **time windows** (refund tiers) — needed for 4B refunds
- Bio is a single DB column serving both locales

## Local dev setup

```
open -a Docker
pnpm exec supabase start           # local stack (ports remapped +1000 — see below)
pnpm exec supabase db reset        # apply migrations + seed
# copy API URL + Publishable/Secret keys from `supabase status` into .env.local
pnpm dev                           # :3000
```

- **Ports remapped +1000** (`supabase/config.toml`: api 55321, db 55322, studio 55323…) to coexist with another local Supabase stack that owns the default 543xx ports. `.env.local` points at `:55321`.
- CLI issues **new-format keys** (`sb_publishable_…` / `sb_secret_…`); `@supabase/ssr` accepts the publishable key in the anon slot.
- **No cloud Supabase project linked yet** (`supabase link --project-ref <ref>` when deploying). `.env.local` gitignored; `.env.example` committed.
- Regenerate DB types after any schema change: `pnpm exec supabase gen types typescript --local > src/lib/supabase/database.types.ts` (then `types.ts` re-exports + aliases).

**Commands:** `pnpm dev` · `pnpm build` · `pnpm typecheck` · `pnpm lint` · `pnpm format`

**Design constraints:** grayscale only (tokens, never hex/rgb; state via icon+text). Every visible string through `t()`; both locales in sync (currently 217 keys each).

---

## Gotchas (cumulative)

- **`redirect()` + typed routes** — use `redirect` from `next/navigation` (reliably `never`) with `` `/${locale}/…` as Route ``; next-intl's `redirect` didn't narrow control flow here. External URLs (Stripe) also cast `as Route`.
- **Supabase session + next-intl in one proxy pass** — `proxy.ts` runs next-intl to get a `NextResponse`, then attaches Supabase auth cookies to *that same response*. Don't create a second response.
- **RLS recursion** — a policy on `users` querying `users` recurses; use `SECURITY DEFINER` helpers with a pinned `search_path`.
- **Public projections behind RLS** — display data (talachero name, review author, booking counterparty) sits behind own-row RLS, so it's exposed via `SECURITY DEFINER` functions returning only safe columns, `grant execute … to anon, authenticated`.
- **Seed runner batching** — `supabase db reset` doesn't preserve session temp tables across statement batches; write seeds as one `DO` block. Seed auth users by inserting into `auth.users` (fires the signup trigger) + a matching `auth.identities` row for password login.
- **Concurrency** — `create_booking` locks the slot with `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` before checking status; racing callers serialize and the loser gets `slot_unavailable`.
- **Server-only money writes** — Stripe/verification columns are `REVOKE UPDATE … FROM authenticated`; the webhook + onboarding actions write them via the service-role client. `bookings` UPDATE is fully revoked from `authenticated` (all mutations go through SECURITY DEFINER functions).
- **Lazy env config** — `src/lib/{supabase,stripe}/config.ts` expose getter functions, not module constants, so importing has no side effects and `next build` works with no env (CI). Verify builds with `.env.local` moved aside.
- **Auth-aware nav made pages dynamic** — `TopNavBar` reads the session, so locale pages render on demand (all `ƒ`). Expected tradeoff.
- **Prettier drift** — the committed Phase 1 files don't all match current prettier output; `pnpm format` reformats unrelated files. Format only the files you touched, or revert incidental reformats before committing.

## What to say to Claude next session

> Continuing Talachas. Phases 0–3 + 4A are merged (see HANDOFF.md). I've verified Stripe Connect onboarding works in test mode. Bring up the local stack and start Phase 4B — payment intents (manual capture, 15% fee + transfer), capture on completion, refunds, tips, and the transactions ledger from payment webhooks. Read `plan.md` §Phase 4 and `prd.md` §6.4 first.

If onboarding verification surfaced issues, report those first before starting 4B.
